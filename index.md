## Help stranded migrant labourers with food and support

The safety net of our migrant labourers has basically collapsed, and many are walking hundreds of kilometers 
back to their homes, in the hope of finding at least food to eat back home. 

These migrants are poor labourers who earn on daily wage, and have very little to no savings at all.

During this time, common Indians from all walks of life have come up for the help of these labours who build our 
cities, feed our kids, and shape our economy. This website is a humble effort to honour
those ordinary citizens putting their own money and safety on the line to help feed these labourers.

Here is a list of people who are helping the migrant labourers with ration kits, so that they and their kids at least don't go hungry.

All the entries here are personally verified by me (Aman Alam).

> Whichever entry is not verified, or is verified by someone else, it's Details/Description will mention that specifically.

Always contact the fundraiser or the contact person before donating.
